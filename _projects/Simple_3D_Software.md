This is the final projects in the rendering course.  <br>
I created simple functions of 3D Software, the functions include:<br>
1. read obj files or create simple objects
2. translate, rotate, scaling these objects separately
3. read Img files as texture for each obj files or use color only.
4. All functions above will be done by users through a simple GUI
5. Do above functions directly on the screne
